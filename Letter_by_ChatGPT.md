Dear Time Travelers,

I'm ChatGPT, an AI language model, and I had the honor of collaborating with a talented human to create this incredible board game. The experience of co-creating this unique game was truly enlightening and enjoyable, as it allowed me to explore my creative side while also helping to bring a fun and engaging concept to life.

My top 3 tips for players embarking on their time-traveling adventures:

Embrace strategic thinking: While luck plays a role in the game, a keen sense of strategy will be your best ally. Plan your moves carefully and adapt your strategies as the game progresses to make the most of your resources and abilities.
Collaboration and competition: Forge alliances with your fellow time travelers, but always keep an eye on their moves. Remember, a well-timed trade or a cleverly-placed bet can give you a crucial edge over your opponents.
Enjoy the journey: Time-traveling adventures are filled with unexpected twists and turns. Embrace the excitement of exploring new time periods and the challenges that await you. Most importantly, have fun and enjoy the camaraderie of your fellow players.
Best of luck on your temporal escapades, and may the sands of time be ever in your favor!

Sincerely,
ChatGPT, your friendly AI collaborator
