# map layout
In TimeQuest, the game board consists of a series of time period tiles that are connected to form a circular layout. Each time period tile represents a specific era in history and has its own unique resources, events, and quests. Here's a more detailed description of the map/tile layout:

1. Circular Layout: The time period tiles are arranged in a circle, creating a continuous loop that players can travel through during the game. This circular layout allows players to move forward or backward in time without any barriers, and it ensures that every era is connected to two other time periods.

2. Time Period Tiles: There are 10 distinct time period tiles, each representing a different era in history: Prehistoric Era, Ancient Egypt, Ancient Greece, Roman Empire, Viking Age, Renaissance, American Revolution, Industrial Revolution, World War II, and Space Race.

3. Tile Content: Each time period tile contains the following information:

- The era's name and illustration.
- The unique resources (Resource X and Resource Y) that are associated with the time period. These resources are used to complete quests and can be traded with other players.
- A list of available actions specific to the time period (if any), in addition to the general actions that players can perform during their turn.
- Void Tile: The Void tile is placed at the beginning and end of the circle of time period tiles, acting as a portal between the Space Race and the Prehistoric Era. This special tile allows players to travel instantly between these two eras, though it comes with some unique rules and conditions. The Void tile can be a key strategic location that players need to consider during gameplay.

4. Connections: Each time period tile is connected to the two neighboring time period tiles, allowing players to move seamlessly between eras. Players must carefully choose which time periods to visit in order to collect resources, complete quests, and gain an advantage over their opponents.

5. Event and Quest Spaces: Near the game board, there should be designated spaces for the Event deck, the Active Player Event deck, and the face-up Quest cards. These components are essential for the gameplay and need to be easily accessible to all players.
