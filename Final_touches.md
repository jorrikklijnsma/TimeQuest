1. Set the amount of player actions? And maybe have one or two player actions take up two of actions a player can do?
2. Create objectives that comply with the new rules. And make them in 3 different levels. I need around 10 objectives per level.
3. I need to come up with a background story for the game, Why are the player traveling through time. I would need names and personas for the characters.
4. I want a different game ending. I want the game to end after 3, 4 or 5 time periods are closed. A time period is closed when it's visited an X amount of time. I need a way to keep track of that and determine how many times a time period can be visited.

## point 3

    In the distant future, Earth is threatened by a catastrophic event known as the Chrono Collapse, which could unravel the fabric of time itself. As the last hope for humanity, an elite team of time travelers called the Chrono Protectors is assembled. These brave souls must embark on a journey through time, unraveling the mystery behind the Collapse and collecting Time Crystals to prevent it from happening.

    Each player takes on the role of one of the Chrono Protectors, each with unique abilities and backgrounds. Together, they must face the challenges of the past, present, and future, while completing quests and forming alliances with the inhabitants of each era.

### Amara "The Archivist" Jones
A brilliant historian and archivist, Amara specializes in using her knowledge of the past to guide the team. She can swiftly gather Knowledge resources and deduce vital clues from ancient texts.

### Dr. Theodore "The Engineer" Marsden
A genius inventor and engineer, Dr. Marsden constructs advanced gadgets and devices to aid the team on their journey. He is an expert in using Stone and Gold resources to create new technologies.

### Ophelia "The Seer" Sinclair
Possessing the rare gift of foresight, Ophelia can peer into the timestream to guide the team's decisions. Her ability to anticipate and manipulate events makes her indispensable during Arena Fights and other challenges.

### Akira "The Diplomat" Tanaka
A skilled negotiator and diplomat, Akira excels at forming alliances and navigating the intricate web of relationships in each time period. He can effectively trade resources and gather support from influential figures in history.

### Isabella "The Explorer" Cortez
Fearless and resourceful, Isabella is the team's expert in navigating the vast expanses of time and space. Her agility and intuition help her discover hidden pathways and lead the team to new locations.

### Malik "The Guardian" Ndlovu
A powerful warrior and defender, Malik ensures the safety of his fellow Chrono Protectors in the face of danger. His physical prowess is unmatched in Arena Fights and other combat scenarios.

    As the Chrono Protectors, players must work together, using their unique abilities to find Time Crystals, complete quests, and ultimately save Earth from the Chrono Collapse. Along the way, they will forge alliances, make powerful enemies, and uncover hidden secrets that could change the course of history forever.



Certainly! Here are unique abilities tailored to each character's persona, adding depth and strategy to the game:

### Amara "The Archivist" Jones - Tome of Knowledge
During her turn, when Amara gains a Knowledge resource, she gains an additional +1 Knowledge. This allows Amara to accumulate valuable information faster and contribute more effectively to her team's progress in the game.

### Dr. Theodore "The Engineer" Marsden
Ability: Master Inventor
Once per turn, Dr. Marsden can convert two Stone resources into one Gold resource or vice versa, allowing him to quickly adapt to the resource demands of his team.

### Ophelia "The Seer" Sinclair
Ability: Temporal Vision
Once per turn, Ophelia can reveal the top card of the Quest or Event deck and choose to either keep it on top or place it at the bottom of the deck. This ability grants her control over the challenges faced by her team.

### Akira "The Diplomat" Tanaka - Silver Tongue
Akira's trades are more appealing to other players due to his persuasive skills. When Akira offers a trade, the receiving player will gain a +1 bonus from the bank of the traded resource. This means that when Akira offers one resource, the other player receives two of that resource. This ability allows Akira to acquire resources more effectively and build stronger alliances.

### Isabella "The Explorer" Cortez - Trailblazer
Isabella has access to her own pile of exclusive Quest cards, known as the "Explorer's Quests." At the beginning of the game, she draws three extra Quest cards from the main Quest deck to create her "Explorer's Quests" pile. Throughout the game, when Isabella chooses to take a new Quest, she can draw from either the main Quest deck or her own "Explorer's Quests" pile. This ability helps Isabella complete her quests more quickly and efficiently.

### Malik "The Guardian" Ndlovu - Guardian's Choice

Combining Malik's protective nature and his strategic mindset, he has the unique ability to support his team through difficult times. Whenever an "All Player" event occurs, Malik can choose to use his Guardian's Choice ability. With this ability, he can either:

    Negate the negative effects of the event for himself and any other player in the same time period (as the Shield of Protection ability). This emphasizes his role as a protector, helping his team avoid adverse consequences.

    Gain an additional resource of his choice for each player (including himself) in the same time period who successfully resolves the event. This showcases Malik's ability to turn challenging situations into opportunities, supporting his team in building their resources.

The Guardian's Choice ability has a cooldown and can only be used once every three turns, making it a powerful but limited tool in supporting Malik's team throughout the game.

## point 4
To implement the game-ending condition where 3, 4, or 5 time periods are closed, you can introduce a "Visits" tracker for each time period. You could use tokens, like "Visit Tokens," to track the number of visits to a specific time period. Here's a suggestion on how to do this:

Place a set of Visit Tokens near the game board.

Determine the maximum number of visits allowed for each time period. For example, you can set a limit of 5 visits.

Each time a player moves to a time period, add a Visit Token to that period's tracker.

When the maximum number of visits for a time period is reached, that time period is considered "closed" and players can no longer move to it.

The game ends when 3, 4, or 5 time periods are closed, depending on the desired game length.

This mechanic will encourage players to strategize and manage their movements across time periods while adding tension as time periods gradually become inaccessible.
