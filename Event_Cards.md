| **Cosmic Lottery:**      | A cosmic lottery takes place, with the chance to win big.                   | Each player can choose to spend 1 resource of any type to enter the lottery. All participating players roll a dice. The player with the highest roll wins all the resources spent by all players.                                                                             |

They must still pay any required costs.                                                                                                               |
| **Quantum Gifts:**       | Quantum gifts are bestowed upon the players by a mysterious benefactor.     | Each player rolls a dice. Based on the result, they receive the gifts as stated in [figure 4](Additional_Info_and_schemas.md#figure-4)   |
| **Time Auction:**        | A time auction is held, with a chance to bid on powerful artifacts.         | A random artifact is drawn. Each player secretly chooses several resources they would like to bid on. The highest bidder wins the artifact and discards the resources they bid. In the case of a tie, the artifact is discarded, and all tied players keep their resources. |
