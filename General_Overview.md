# TimeQuest

## The story
    In the distant future, Earth is threatened by a catastrophic event known as the Chrono Collapse, which could unravel the fabric of time itself. As the last hope for humanity, an elite team of time travelers called the Chrono Protectors is assembled. These brave souls must embark on a journey through time, unraveling the mystery behind the Collapse and collecting Time Crystals to prevent it from happening.

    Each player takes on the role of one of the Chrono Protectors, each with unique abilities and backgrounds. Together, they must face the challenges of the past, present, and future, while completing quests and forming alliances with the inhabitants of each era.

## Objective

TimeQuest is a strategy-based board game for 2-5 players, combining elements of resource management, pathfinding, and adventure. The objective of the game is to collect the most Time Crystals by completing various quests while traveling through time and visiting different historical periods and locations.

## Components

- 10 Time Period tiles.
- 1 Void Time tile
- 1 battle Arena tile
- 5 Time Traveler Tokens (one for each player)
- 5 Crystal Collection Tokens (one for each player)
- 10 Visit Tokens: to track the number of visits to each time period.
- 1 First Player Token
- 5 Player Boards (with place for Resources and Event/Action Cards)
- 100 Quest Cards (10 for each historical period)
- 60 Time Crystal Tokens
- 60 Event Cards/Action Cards (special events, challenges, effects)
- 2 dice
- Resource Tokens:
  - 30 Food
  - 30 Gold
  - 30 Knowledge
  - 30 Cloth
  - 30 Stone

## Setup

1. Place the Time Periods and Void tiles in order in a circle on the table. [See Map layout](Map_Layout.md)
2. Each player chooses a Time Traveler token and places it on the starting point of the Time Map (the Void tile).
3. Each player takes a Player Board and places it in front of them.
4. Create a separate deck of Quest cards. Shuffle the deck and place it face-down near the game board. Reveal the top 4 cards (or 3 cards when played with 4 or more players) and place them face-up beside the deck. These face-up cards are the available quests that players can complete during the game.
5. Shuffle the Event Cards and place them in a face-down deck near the game board.
6. Place the resource tokens and Time Crystal tokens in separate piles near the game board to form the supply.
7. Randomly determine the first player and give them the First Player Token.
8. Each player starts the game with a set of basic resources. They can choose 7 resources with a maximum of 3 of the same items.
9. Create three separate decks of "All Player" event cards for each difficulty level: Easy, Moderate, and Difficult. Shuffle each deck and place it on the table, first Easy events, and next to it the Moderate and Difficult events.

## Gameplay

### active player actions:
The game is played over a series of rounds, with each player taking one turn per round. On their turn, a player must perform one of the following actions:

Players can perform up to 4 actions per turn.
Actions consume 1 action point except for "Enter the Void" and "Arena Fight" actions consume 2 action points.

#### 1. Move:

1. Move their Time Traveler token to a different time on the Time Map. (horizontal movement only) The player may move to a location in a previous or future historical period by spending the Time Crystals required. A single jump to an adjacent location costs one Time Crystal.
2. Pay the number of time crystals required for the jump.
3. Turn the Crystal Collection Token face-up. (if already faced up, nothing happens)
4. If there is another player already present at the destination time period, draw the top card from the Active Player Event deck and resolve its effects. They can try to achieve the goal, if successful they can use that event in their current turn. (_If they don't use the event before their turn is over, the events get discarded._)

#### 2. Collect Resources:

The player collects resources from the location their Time Traveler token is currently in. The resources available at each location are indicated on the game board.

#### 3. Complete a Quest:

The player selects one of the face-up Quest cards and pays the required X and Y resources associated with the time period they are currently in. The resource costs will be indicated as X and Y on the Quest card, while the specific resources for X and Y are listed on the current time period tile. Once the player has paid the required resources, they gain the Time Crystals indicated on the Quest card and discard it. Replace the completed Quest card with a new one drawn from the top of the Quest deck.

#### 5. Draw an Action Card:

The player draws the top card from the Action Card deck. Action Cards can be stored for later. Executed imminently or added to your character action slot.

#### 6. Arena Fight: (costs 2 actions)

The player challenges another player in the Battle Arena. Both players roll a single dice and the lowest number is subtracted from the highest number. The difference between those two numbers is the number of items the player can collect/gain/retrieve from the bank.

#### 7. Enter the Void (with conditions): (costs 2 actions)
The active player may choose to enter the Void tile, which connects to the Prehistoric Era and the Space Race time period tiles. This action allows the player to travel between the first and last time periods without going through all intervening time periods. However, there are certain conditions that the player must meet to take this action. (see the section about 'The Void')

#### 8. Free Move:
Move to an adjacent time period without spending a Time Crystal, but it can be the only action in your turn, regardless of the extra powers or effects that are at play.

### unlimited active player actions:
Trade with other players.

### Inactive player actions:

#### 1. Betting in the arena:

On the Battle Arena tile, there are betting spots. There are 4 betting spots:

- higher or equal to 2
- higher or equal to 3
- higher or equal to 4
- higher or equal to 5

Inactive players are allowed to place a bet on the battle in the arena. They place any amount of resources that they want, in a betting spot. When de dice are rolled, the bets are collected and paid out. When the outcome tile matches the battle's outcome, they gain the same amount of resources as the tile they are on. (this means that they do not receive back their payment, only what they won)

    for example: when a player puts a stone resource on the 'higher or equal to 3' spot and the dice in the arena display a 6 and a 2. The outcome of the battle is 4. The 4 matches the predicted amount on the betting tile (being higher than 3). All the payments are collected and the players with the correct bets receive their gained resources.

After all, players have taken a turn, and the round ends. The First Player Token is passed to the next player in clockwise order, and a new round begins.

## [Event Card](Event_Cards.md)
### All Player Events
At the start of each new round, before the active player takes their turn, an "All Player" event card will be drawn from the designated Event Card deck. These events affect all players and can offer opportunities for cooperation or competition. The events are divided into three difficulty levels: Easy, Moderate, and Difficult. They will be drawn in ascending order of difficulty as the game progresses. All the players may try to solve the event. (not required, you can choose to fail) Check the players in order (starting with the active player) if the conditions for the event card have been met. If the conditions are met, apply the positive outcome as described on the card. If the conditions are not met, apply the negative outcome as described on the card. Discard the "All Player" event card and begin the next round.

### Active Player Events
Active player events are triggered when a player moves to a time period where another player is already present. The active player will draw the top card from the Active Player Event deck and resolve its effects. These events can either be beneficial or detrimental and might have different levels of difficulty or potential rewards. The events are designed to create interesting interactions between players and add an element of unpredictability to the game.

## [Quests Cards](Quest_Cards.md)

In addition to the standard actions available to the active player, players can also complete a Quest as one of their actions during their turn. These quests are objectives that players can fulfill to gain Time Crystals, with varying costs and rewards depending on the resources associated with the time period they are currently in.

## Closing a Time Period
Each time a player moves to a time period, move the Visit Token one step down that period's tracker.
When the time period runs out of visits, that time period is considered "closed," and players can no longer move to it.
The game continues until 3, 4, or 5 time periods are closed, depending on the desired game length. You can adjust the number of closed time periods required to end the game to suit your preferences.

## End of the Game

When the predetermined number of time periods are closed (e.g., 3, 4, or 5 time periods), the game enters the "Final Round." Each player gets one last turn in the Final Round, and then the game ends.

To calculate the final scores, players convert their Artifacts and Time Crystals into Time Credit Score points. Each Artifact is worth 1 Time Credit Score point, and every 6 Time Crystals are worth 1 Time Credit Score point as well. Players should sum up their Time Credit Score points to determine their final scores.

The player with the highest Time Credit Score wins. In case of a tie, the tied players engage in an Arena Battle using their remaining Time Crystals. The tied players bet (anonymously) their Time Crystals and two players roll the dice, following the same rules as betting with resources. Players will lose their Time Crystals on a wrong bet. The player who accumulates the most Time Crystals in the Arena Battle is declared the winner. If a tie still persists, the victory is shared among the tied players.

### Artifact victory

When a player manages to get an artifact for all the Time Periods and completes their objective, they can immediately claim victory by showing their artifacts and completed objective.

### The VOID
#### Using the void as a portal:
Players can travel to the Void tile from any time period by spending a lower amount of Time Crystals (2 Time Crystals). Once on the Void tile, players can choose to travel to any other time period by spending a higher amount of Time Crystals (3 Time Crystals).
    *Note: If the player enters The VOID from an adjacent time period, by paying one Time Crystal, the player is not using The VOID as a portal. But the player is allowed to use the portal's dice to roll for the benefits and continue its turn. The player can not use 3 Time Crystals to leave The Void for any other Time Period than an adjacent one. The player does not have to pay a penalty.

#### Special Rules:
Players who end their turn on the Void tile must pay a penalty of 1 Time Crystal. This penalty goes to the player who has the least artifacts. In case of a tie, the penalty is backed by the bank.

#### Benefits:
While on the Void tile, players have a chance to obtain unique resources or cards. Players can choose to roll one dice and gain resources according to [ figure 6](Additional_Info_and_schemas.md#figure-6), or roll two dice and gain double resources if the sum of the dice results in an integer when divided by 2. If the sum of the dice is uneven, they get nothing.

#### Conditions:
To enter the Void tile, players must have 2 artifacts in their possession.

## Payments

## Per Era

[See figure 1](Additional_Info_and_schemas.md#figure-1)

### Payment Frequency

[See figure 2](Additional_Info_and_schemas.md#figure-2)

## [Quest cards](Quest_Cards.md)

Time Crystals can only be collected in time periods by paying the required resources for the quest cards available in that era. As a player action, they have the option to pay the necessary resources to collect Time Crystals. Each Quest Card has designated resources for Time Crystal collection, as shown in the tables below. After a player gained Time Crystals, they turn their Crystal Collection Token upside down. With the Crystal Collection Token turned down, they can no longer gain Time Crystals. (They can buy Quest Cards if there is no Time Crystal gain involved). After moving to another time period the Crystal Collection Token is turned 'active' again!

### Artifacts
For every Era, there are artifacts. These items can be obtained by buying a Quest Card with a 'Time Crystal gain' and putting it in your inventory. You pay the number of Time Crystals on the quest card plus an additional amount of resources, depending on the number of artifacts you already have. The additional resource cost is equal to the number of artifacts the player already possesses, and the player can choose which resources to pay from their inventory.

#### Benefits of Artifacts:
Each artifact has a unique ability that provides its owner with a passive benefit or a one-time use power. Examples of artifact benefits could include additional resources, extra actions, Time Crystal discounts, or the ability to reroll dice. The specific benefits are determined by the artifact's design and should be balanced across all artifacts in the game.

#### Artifact Loss:
A player may lose an artifact under specific circumstances:

If a player is on the same time period tile as another player, they may challenge the other player to an "Artifact Duel" as an action. Both players roll a dice, and the player with the higher roll wins the duel. The losing player must give one artifact of their choice to the winner. If the challenged player declines the duel, they must give the challenger one of their resources.
Some Event or Action cards may have effects that cause a player to lose an artifact. These effects should be rare and balanced within the deck.

## [Personal Objectives](Personal_Objectives.md)

Personal Objectives are an optional variant that adds individual goals for each player in addition to the main objective of collecting Time Crystals. To include Personal Objectives in your game, shuffle the Personal Objective Cards and deal one face-down to each player at the beginning of the game. Players keep their objectives secret until they achieve them. Achieving a Personal Objective rewards the player with bonus points at the end of the game, as specified on the card.
