    Gain an additional resource of her choice for each player (including herself) in the same time period who successfully resolves the event. This showcases Malik's ability to turn challenging situations into opportunities, supporting her team in building their resources.

The Guardian's Choice ability has a cooldown and can only be used once every two turns, making it a powerful but limited tool in supporting Malik's team throughout the game.

The Guardian's Choice ability has a cooldown and can only be used once every three turns, making it a powerful but limited tool in supporting Malik's team throughout the game.
