A brilliant historian and archivist, Amara specializes in using her knowledge of the past to guide the team. She can swiftly gather Knowledge resources and deduce vital clues from ancient texts.

### _Special Ability:_ **Tome of Knowledge**
During her turn, when Amara gains a Knowledge resource, she gains an additional +1 Knowledge. This allows Amara to accumulate valuable information faster and contribute more effectively to her team's progress in the game.

## 2. Dr. Theodore "The Engineer" Marsden
A genius inventor and engineer, Dr. Marsden constructs advanced gadgets and devices to aid the team on their journey. He is an expert in using Stone and Gold resources to create new technologies.

### _Special Ability:_ **Master Inventor**
Once per turn, Dr. Marsden can convert two Stone resources into one Gold resource or vice versa, allowing him to quickly adapt to the resource demands of his team.

## 3. Ophelia "The Seer" Sinclair
Possessing the rare gift of foresight, Ophelia can peer into the timestream to guide the team's decisions. Her ability to anticipate and manipulate events makes her indispensable during Arena Fights and other challenges.

### _Special Ability:_ **Temporal Vision*
Once per turn, Ophelia can reveal the top card of the Quest or Event deck and choose to either keep it on top or place it at the bottom of the deck. This ability grants her control over the challenges faced by her team.

## 4. Akira "The Diplomat" Tanaka
A skilled negotiator and diplomat, Akira excels at forming alliances and navigating the intricate web of relationships in each time period. He can effectively trade resources and gather support from influential figures in history.

### _Special Ability:_ **Silver Tongue**
Akira's trades are more appealing to other players due to his persuasive skills. When Akira offers a trade, the receiving player will gain a +1 bonus from the bank of the traded resource. This means that when Akira offers one resource, the other player receives two of that resource. This ability allows Akira to acquire resources more effectively and build stronger alliances.

## 5. Isabella "The Explorer" Cortez
Fearless and resourceful, Isabella is the team's expert in navigating the vast expanses of time and space. Her agility and intuition help her discover hidden pathways and lead the team to new locations.

### _Special Ability:_ *Trailblazer**
Isabella has access to her own pile of exclusive Quest cards, known as the "Explorer's Quests." At the beginning of the game, she draws three extra Quest cards from the main Quest deck to create her "Explorer's Quests" pile. Throughout the game, when Isabella chooses to take a new Quest, she can draw from either the main Quest deck or her own "Explorer's Quests" pile. This ability helps Isabella complete her quests more quickly and efficiently.

## 6. Malik "The Guardian" Ndlovu
A powerful warrior and defender, Malik ensures the safety of his fellow Chrono Protectors in the face of danger. His physical prowess is unmatched in Arena Fights and other combat scenarios.

    As the Chrono Protectors, players must work together, using their unique abilities to find Time Crystals, complete quests, and ultimately save Earth from the Chrono Collapse. Along the way, they will forge alliances, make powerful enemies, and uncover hidden secrets that could change the course of history forever.

### _Special Ability:_ **Guardian's Choice**
Combining Malik's protective nature and his strategic mindset, he has the unique ability to support his team through difficult times. Whenever an "All Player" event occurs, Malik can choose to use his Guardian's Choice ability. With this ability, he can either:

    Negate the negative effects of the event for himself and any other player in the same time period (as the Shield of Protection ability). This emphasizes his role as a protector, helping his team avoid adverse consequences.

    Gain an additional resource of his choice for each player (including himself) in the same time period who successfully resolves the event. This showcases Malik's ability to turn challenging situations into opportunities, supporting his team in building their resources.

The Guardian's Choice ability has a cooldown and can only be used once every three turns, making it a powerful but limited tool in supporting Malik's team throughout the game.
